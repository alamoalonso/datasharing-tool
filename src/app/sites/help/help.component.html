        <app-help-tag dimension="Type" explanation="The first dimension is a matter of Data Types. First, process data describes all data which occurs from the operation of a machine and represents the current status of the process in the control system. Product data is measured at the processing units and provides valuable information about the production process. To include information about the natural environment like air, climate or water, the characteristic environmental emerged. Furthermore, the characteristic ´human´ can be used for all data concerning humans. Since this dimension cannot be fully specified because of the wide range of data types, we use the characteristic other for further options, but provide the most common data types for the manufacturing industry as aforementioned."></app-help-tag>

        <app-help-tag dimension="Source" explanation="Since we look at the taxonomy through the lens of the service provider, the four characteristics can be subdivided into internal data sources and into external sources. Self-generated data can be created internally, e.g., sensor data from the service provider’s machines while performing development and tests. External data can be obtained in different ways. Acquired data is purchased from data providers on data marketplaces, while free available data can be downloaded at no charge. Lastly, customer-provided data comprises relevant machine-generated process and product data for the creation of data-driven services as well as already existing, mostly unused, data in the customer’s IT systems."></app-help-tag>

        <app-help-tag dimension="Sovereignity" explanation=" Here, the data ownership dimension indicates the context to which it is assigned. It
        distinguishes whether data ownership is located at an
        individual, organizational or shared entity.
        Data ownership from the individual perspective
        indicates rights relating to personal data. In the
        organizational context, data ownership is claimed by an
        enterprise based on data creation or by engaging in
        economic activities such as purchasing, licensing or
        funding data to stake a claim to data ownership. Shared
        ownership describes a setting without any restrictions
        over the ownership of data. This characteristic is
        associated with the open data paradigm, where data is
        made freely accessible and can be used accordingly by
        everyone

        <app-help-tag dimension="Motivation" explanation="Economic motives include all commercial aspects that can lead to a competitive advantage such as
        money, customer loyalty, or a strategic market position. Social and ecological motives usually have the goal of contributing to
        the benefit of other ecosystem actors or the general public such as corporate social responsibility. Legal motives can be based on national or international laws or policies that oblige to share
        certain data, e.g. in publicly funded research projects or in the banking context. The cultural characteristic includes all culturally motivated interests such as the general
        organisational culture towards data sharing."></app-help-tag>
        <app-help-tag dimension="Scope" explanation="The scope dimension considers the extent
        of engagement and participants. We distinguish
        between an intra-organizational and interorganizational scope.
        Although ecosystems refer to inter-organizational
        engagement between multiple firms, the majority of
        research focuses on the focal actor and its ecosystem
        governance. These central actors are capable of
        setting governance structures within their intraorganizational and controllable environment to manage
        their respective ecosystems. Sources relate to intraorganizational in the context of managing big data with
        the adequate software and hardware stack, i.e., software
        ecosystem or big data ecosystem. The distinction is
        further required as it affects how and which governance
        instruments can be deployed to enforce control within a
        focal firm (e.g., platform owner) and its ecosystem or
        within the whole ecosystem."></app-help-tag>
        <app-help-tag dimension="Reward" explanation="The simplest way of payment is money as money is easy to handle and applicable to many situations. However, if a distributed ledger technology such as blockchain is used to share
        the data, virtual assets such as cryptocurrencies can be used for payment. One of
        A Taxonomy of Incentive Mechanisms for Data Sharing
        Twenty-fifth Pacific Asia Conference on Information Systems, Dubai, UAE, 2021 8
        the advantages of this is that payments can be automated on the blockchain using smart contracts, for
        example. Besides a direct payment as a reward, there are also incentive mechanisms
        that use bartering. On the one hand, this can be bartering of data for data as it
        takes place, for example, between some hospitals. On the other hand, the data
        provider can also be offered some kind of service in exchange for his data. However, this comes along with the challenge that these services must first be
        developed, configured, and deployed. Another type of reward mentioned in the
        literature is reputation which can have different manifestations. Firstly, reputation is often mentioned
        when it comes to sharing research data from which the researcher subsequently expects citations and
        acknowledgement in the scientific community as a reward. Secondly, Xie et
        al. (2020) were able to show that possible community recognition is a reason for users of Internet
        platforms to share their data. Lastly, there are papers describing ecosystems in which data consumers
        rate data providers based on their shared data and its quality. Increased reputation value could then allow the data provider to attract more consumers. Finally, it is also possible that the data provider receives no reward at all for sharing its
        data. This may be the case when government agencies or non-profit organisations share their data
        publicly."></app-help-tag>
        <app-help-tag dimension="Payment model" explanation="Firstly, a data provider can make its data available free of
        charge (Muschalle et al. 2013). This can be the case when public authorities or non-profit organisations
        have to publish their data or when data providers, e.g. a data marketplace, try to attract new customers
        (Muschalle et al. 2013). However, insofar as payment takes place, the simplest payment method is a
        fixed reward for a specified amount of data. This can be a fixed amount of money or a specified amount
        of data or even a defined service (Badewitz et al. 2020). As a second payment model, subscription
        models are presented in the literature (Fricker and Maksimov 2017). Al-Zahrani (2020) describes, for
        example, a model in which a data consumer subscribes to a data provider for a specific period of time
        to get access to the data and pays according to a negotiated subscription plan. In addition, there are also
        payment models that are usage-based and charge according to the number of data accesses, for example
        (Muschalle et al. 2013). Furthermore, there exist payment models based on how much revenue the data
        consumer makes with the shared data (Shen et al. 2020). These models can have the advantage that the
        data provider also has an incentive to offer its data in a high quality as this probably has a positive effect
        on the revenue generated (Badewitz et al. 2020). The main challenge in these models, however, is to
        calculate the contribution that a data set has on the revenue of the data consumer. This is especially
        difficult when multiple data sets from different data providers are merged and analysed by one data
        consumer (Shen et al. 2020). Finally, there are also hybrid models of the above-mentioned payment
        models (Zheng et al. 2019). For example, Zeng et al. (2018) propose a model in which a data consumer
        must pay a fixed price plus a variable price proportional to the revenue generated from the data.
        Freemium models are also possible where a certain amount of data is shared free of charge and
        additional data possibly with a higher quality is shared for a fee."></app-help-tag>

        <app-help-tag dimension="Benefits" explanation="In close relation to the main value is the dimension Main Outcome (D12), which concretizes the value gain of the value proposition for the customer. Regarding efficiency gains (C121), data-driven services lead to benefits such as cost reductions, time savings, or increased flexibility (Wünderlich et al. 2013). Improved quality (C122) describes, for example, the increased quality of manufactured products through data-driven quality control. Uncovering hidden links between disparate data sets and sifting vast data sources will create new insights (C123) based on unbiased and automated information and thus support business decisions (Blaschke et al. 2019). A new offering (C124), for example, is real-time analytics on highly variable human actions through action recognition. Since manufacturers struggle to measure the value of people, such new data-driven services can analyze activities and hence improve human-based operations"></app-help-tag>
